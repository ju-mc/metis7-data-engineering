Goal: to analyze the NFT market (specifically within Opensea.io) -- trends, popular items, users with high sales. The analysis will be displayed in
a streamlit web application

Data: I will scrape data from Opensea.io using their API. The data will include information about sellers, buyers, assets, selling price, etc

MVP: 
The MVP will include an established mongo database with the data mentioned above, and at least some visualizations describing the state
of the NFT marketplace within Opensea
